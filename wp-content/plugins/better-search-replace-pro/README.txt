A simple plugin for updating URLs or other text in a database.

== Description ==

When moving your WordPress site to a new domain or server, you will likely run into a need to run a search/replace on the database for everything to work correctly. Fortunately, there are several plugins available for this task, however, all have a different approach to a few key features. This plugin consolidates the best features from these plugins, incorporating the following features in a simple, ad-free plugin:

* Serialization support for all tables
* The ability to select specific tables
* The ability to run a "dry run" to see how many fields will be updated
* No server requirements aside from a running installation of WordPress
* WordPress Multisite support

The search/replace functionality is heavily based on interconnect/it's great and open-source Search Replace DB script, modified to use WordPress native database functions to ensure compatibility.

**Supported Languages**

* English
* French
* German
* Spanish

== Installation ==

Install Better Search Replace like you would install any other WordPress plugin.

Dashboard Method:

1. Login to your WordPress admin and go to Plugins -> Add New
2. Type "Better Search Replace" in the search bar and select this plugin
3. Click "Install", and then "Activate Plugin"


Upload Method:

1. Unzip the plugin and upload the "better-search-replace" folder to your 'wp-content/plugins' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Using Better Search Replace =

Once activated, Better Search Replace will add a page under the "Tools" menu page in your WordPress admin.

= Is my host supported? =

Yes! This plugin should be compatible with any host.

= Can I damage my site with this plugin? =

Yes! Entering a wrong search or replace string could damage your database. Because of this, it is always adviseable to have a backup of your database before using this plugin.

= How does this work on WordPress Multisite? =

When running this plugin on a WordPress Multisite installation, it will only be loaded and visible for Network admins. Network admins can go to the dashboard of any subsite to run a search/replace on just the tables for that subsite, or go to the dashboard of the main/base site to run a search/replace on all tables.

= How can I use this plugin when changing URLs? =

If you're moving your site from one server to another and changing the URL of your WordPress installation, the approach below allows you to do so easily without affecting the old site:

1. Backup the database on your current site
2. Install the database on your new host
3. On the new host, define the new site URL in the `wp-config.php` file, as shown [here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_The_Site_URL#Edit_wp-config.php)
4. Log in at your new admin URL and run Better Search Replace on the old site URL for the new site URL
5. Delete the site_url constant you added to `wp-config.php`. You may also need to regenerate your .htaccess by going to Settings -> Permalinks and saving the settings.

More information on moving WordPress can be found [here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Moving_WordPress).

= I get a white screen when using this plugin? =

This is likely an issue with your PHP memory limit. Try temporarily increasing it by defining the memory limit in your `wp-config.php` file as shown [here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php#Increasing_memory_allocated_to_PHP). Alternatively, if you were searching across multiple tables, try searching on fewer tables at a time to load less into memory.

== Screenshots ==

1. The Better Search Replace page added to the "Tools" menu
2. After running a search/replace dry-run.
