== Description ==

The Load More block in WordPress Gutenberg is a game-changer! It allows users to display a set number of posts initially and then load more with a single click. This feature is perfect for content-heavy websites, making it easy for visitors to browse through more posts without leaving the page. It's used within the Query Loop block, which controls the post display. The Load More Posts block can be customized to load specific categories, tags, or post types. Say goodbye to boring blog archives and hello to a dynamic, engaging user experience!
